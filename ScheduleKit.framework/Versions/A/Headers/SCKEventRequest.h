/**
 *  The SCKEventRequest class represents a structure used by an
 *  SCKEventManager object to encapsulate relevant info and to handle
 *  new events when reloading events asynchronously.
 *
 *  Asynchronous event loading is disabled by default. You may enable it
 *  by setting SCKEventManager's @c loadsEventsAsynchronously to YES. When
 *  this is set, @c -eventManager:requestsEventsBetweenDate:andDate:  won't 
 *  be called on data source. Instead, @c -eventManager:didMakeEventRequest:
 *  will get called with an SCKEventRequest object as a parameter. Then, the
 *  data source is responsible of keeping a (weak) reference to this
 *  request, loading the apropiated events asynchronously and, when done,
 *  passing them back to the request via @c -completeWithEvents: on the
 *  main queue.
